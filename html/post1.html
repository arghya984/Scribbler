        Since JavaScript does not have any type-checking, either of these
        keywords can be used to declare a variable of any type (datatype) in
        JavaScript. Though all the three keywords are used for the same purpose,
        they are different. When it comes to declaring variables in JavaScript,
        developers often face the dilemma of choosing between var, let, and
        const. Each of these keywords has its own specific use cases and
        behavior, and understanding the differences between them is crucial for
        writing clean, maintainable code. Let's start with var. var is the
        oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript, and it has been around
        since the early days of the language. When you declare a variable using
        var, it is scoped to the nearest function block, rather than the nearest
        enclosing block like let and const. This can sometimes lead to
        unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with loops or nested
        functions. On the other hand, let and const were introduced in ES6
        (ECMAScript 2015) to address some of the shortcomings of var and provide
        more predictable behavior. let allows you to declare block-scoped
        variables, which means they are only accessible within the block they
        are declared in, whether it's a loop, a conditional statement, or a
        function. This helps prevent unintended variable hoisting and scope
        pollution. Similarly, const also declares block-scoped variables, but
        with one key difference: the value of a const variable cannot be
        reassigned once it has been initialized. This makes const ideal for
        declaring constants or immutable values that should not change
        throughout the execution of a program. However, it's important to note
        that const does not make the variable's value immutable; it only
        prevents reassignment of the variable itself. By using let and const
        instead of var, developers can write more predictable and maintainable
        code, as it reduces the risk of accidental variable hoisting,
        scope-related bugs, and unintended variable mutations. In conclusion,
        while all three keywords (var, let, and const) serve the purpose of
        declaring variables in JavaScript, they have different behaviors and use
        cases. By understanding these differences and choosing the appropriate
        keyword for each scenario, developers can write cleaner, more reliable
        code. With this knowledge, let's strive to be constants in our code,
        providing stability and predictability, rather than variables that can
        change unexpectedly. Let's embrace the power of let and const to write
        better JavaScript code for ourselves and our fellow developers.
