      ‘let’ me be a ‘const’(ant), not a ‘var’(iable)!
    </h3>
    <h4> Srishti Gupta</h4>
    <p> Since JavaScript does not have any type-checking, either of these
        keywords can be used to declare a variable of any type (datatype) in
        JavaScript. Though all the three keywords are used for the same
        purpose, they are different.</p>

    What is linting and how can it save you time?
  </h3>
  <h4>Colby Fayock</h4>
  <p> One of the biggest challenges in software development is time. It’s
    something we can’t easily get more of, but linting can help us make
    the most out of the time we have.

    How to write easily describable code
  </h3>
  <h4> Cedd Burge</h4>
  <p> When code is not describable using words, most people have to do
    some mental mapping to turn it in to words. This wastes mental
    energy, and you run the risk of getting the mapping wrong. Different
    people will map to different words, which leads to confusion when
    discussing the code.</p>
