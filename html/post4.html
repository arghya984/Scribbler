      <h3>How to write easily describable code</h3>

        When code is not describable using words, most people have to do some
        mental mapping to turn it into words. This wastes mental energy, and you
        run the risk of getting the mapping wrong. Different people will map to
        different words, which leads to confusion when discussing the code. To
        write easily describable code, it's essential to follow best practices
        for code readability and documentation. One approach is to use
        meaningful variable names, function names, and comments to convey the
        intent and purpose of your code. Instead of cryptic abbreviations or
        single-letter variable names, opt for descriptive names that accurately
        represent the data or functionality they represent. This makes it easier
        for others (and your future self) to understand the code without having
        to decipher each line. Additionally, breaking down complex logic into
        smaller, self-contained functions with clear names and purposes can make
        the code easier to describe and reason about. Each function should
        ideally do one thing well and have a clear input-output relationship,
        reducing the cognitive load required to understand its behavior.
        Furthermore, documenting your code with inline comments or documentation
        comments (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript) can provide valuable context and
        explanations for future readers. Comments should not only describe what
        the code does but also why it does it and any relevant considerations or
        edge cases. By adopting these practices, you can write code that is
        easily describable using words, reducing mental overhead and
        facilitating better communication and collaboration among team members.
