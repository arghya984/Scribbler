        Node.js treats each JavaScript file as a separate module. For instance,
        if you have a file containing some code and this file is named xyz.js,
        then this file is treated as a module in Node, and you can say that
        you’ve created a module named xyz. This modular approach is fundamental
        to Node.js development, as it allows developers to organize their code
        into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and
        maintain large codebases. Modules encapsulate related functionality,
        variables, and objects, allowing developers to structure their
        applications in a modular and scalable way. One of the key features of
        Node.js modules is the ability to import functionality from one module
        into another using the require function. The require function is used to
        include modules in Node.js applications, allowing developers to leverage
        existing modules or libraries, as well as modules they've created
        themselves. When you require a module in Node.js, the module's code is
        executed, and any exported functionality is made available for use in
        the current module. This enables developers to break down their
        applications into smaller, more manageable pieces, each responsible for
        a specific aspect of the application's functionality. By leveraging
        modules and the require function, developers can write cleaner, more
        modular code, improving code organization, reusability, and
        maintainability. Additionally, Node.js provides a built-in module system
        that includes core modules (such as fs for file system operations and
        http for creating HTTP servers) as well as modules installed via npm
        (Node Package Manager). These modules can be easily imported into your
        application using the require function, allowing you to quickly add
        powerful functionality to your Node.js applications. In summary,
        understanding modules and the require function is essential for Node.js
        developers. By leveraging modules, developers can organize their code
        into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and
        maintain complex applications. The require function allows developers to
        import functionality from one module into another, enabling code reuse
        and promoting a modular architecture. Whether you're building a small
        script or a large-scale application, mastering modules and require will
        help you write cleaner, more maintainable Node.js code.
